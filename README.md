### How to generate obfuscated code

    grunt concat

### How to generate zip for mozilla firefox

    grunt release-firefox

Zip will be created in builds/firefox directory

### Additional Notes

- Handlebars is used for generating markup which is sanitized before injected into DOM. Code is inside BaseView.js.
Inside app.js you may see jquery .html() but it just takes backbone views el and adds to empty element in DOM.
Since Backbone views have sanitized html, above step is also safe.

Why do I need Requestly ?
-------------------------

Requestly is built with intention to help web developers debug JS issues on sites running in production environment.<br/>
User just needs to create a redirect rule and redirect the JS running in production environment to JS from your local machine.<br/>
Now, make changes on your local setup and test it on your site in production.

**Other Perks:**
Requestly can also be used to keep you away from time killing sites.<br/>
Just create a rule to redirect yourself from facebook.com, twitter.com to stackoverflow.com and do some geeky stuff there.
